                            The player can begin (and later have the option to continue) a career that places them in
                            control of a motorsport racing team. When starting a new career, the user can customise the
                            team name and colour, before selecting a racing series to enter. There are four tiers of
                            racing series, where each successive tier can be unlocked by winning each respective racing
                            series per tier once. The game features a hints & tips tutorial system, represented by a
                            sprite textbox, written in the character of a moustached man named Nigel (as a homage to
                            former British racing car driver, Nigel Mansell), who provides first-time advice throughout
                            the game. The user also has the ability to invest into a young driver development programme,
                            appointing head engineers and drivers, improving their team headquarters as well as
                            developing their car to get an edge over the competition, all of which can vary in quality
                            depending on investment level. Cash required for investment into such things can be acquired
                            by signing sponsorship deals and completing challenges appointed by sponsors to earn bonus
                            payments, which may vary in quality, difficulty, quantity and contract duration depending on
                            the success and popularity of the user's racing team, with a secondary method being through
                            earning money at the end of the racing season based on the Team Championship scores.</p>
                        <p>The game also includes a random events system, which may provide choices to the player that
                            can compromise the player's popularity as a manager with one group for the sake of another,
                            or it may provide optional upgrade choices to the three research segments in the game at the
                            cost of cash: Manufacturing - which determines car reliability and tyre wear - Design -
                            which generally affects all aspects of the car - and Aerodynamics - which affects car
                            downforce and acceleration - all of which can trigger at any time during or at the end of a
                            racing season. The user's choices behind-the-scenes ultimately affect their team's racing
                            performances, which is pivotal to success in the game, and serves as the main gameplay
                            element of Motorsport Manager.</p>
                        <p><em>There are over a dozen race tracks featured in-game that share the likeness of their
                                real-life counterparts, all of which are split into the respective racing series in the
                                game. Each track used in a racing series roster is split into two parts - a one-time
                                qualifying session and the final race, the team's qualifying performance determines
                                their starting positions in the final race. Challenges set by sponsors may offer the
                                player a considerable sum of cash if they achieve a set position in the leaderboards,
                                which can prove useful to apply any changes to their team in order to give a better
                                chance of success on race day.</em></p>
                        <p>Exclusive to the mobile version, micro-transactions that supply customers with set amounts of
                            cash can also accelerate the rate at which their team can improve, reducing the time and
                            challenge required to develop a fully-fledged racing team in the game. The third version
                            included new graphics and camera modes. The third version of the mobile game was the first
                            to have augmented reality (AR), when viewing races.

                About the PC version, Eurogamer wrote that "It's all been retooled thoughtfully for its debut on PC, Mac
                and Linux [compared to the original mobile version] - this isn't the mobile game with a few bits of
                extra bodywork thrown on, and instead is a totally new beast, built from the ground up." Largely similar
                to the mobile version of the game, the player has the option to either create their own racing team or
                has the additional option to join a fictional motorsport racing team.
