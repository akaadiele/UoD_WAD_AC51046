# Motorsport Manager Wikipedia Page

This is the repository for team STAR's first coursework for our Web Development Module.

We were tasked with creating a functional and responsive website based on a given wikipedia page. Using the content provided we made a working website with consistent styles and colour pallette.

Our team was given [Motorsport Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport_Manager).
Here is our deployed [site](https://universityofdundee-computing.github.io/cw1-web-development-project-motorsport-manager/)
