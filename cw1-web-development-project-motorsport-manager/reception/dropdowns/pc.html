                    Websites that early-tested the game gave it very positive reviews. In May 2016, PC Gamer's Sean
                    Clever wrote: "It’s a niche subgenre, and one I didn’t expect to see outside of an FIA licence, but
                    this seems like a decent first effort to put racing management games back on the grid."[26] In
                    August 2016, IGN's Luke Reilly stated: "It’s an incredibly nuanced experience and, while it’s
                    initially rather intimidating, Motorsport Manager has successfully got its tentacles around me after
                    several sessions with an early version of the game. ... I also like the pressure of race day and the
                    genuinely stressful situations that can arise."[27]</p>
                <!-- Post release -->

                <p>
                    The game received positive reviews after release. Eurogamer.net's Martin Robinson reports the lack
                    of the ability to save or copy racing set-ups, and writes: "Such an approachable veneer disguises an
                    otherwise complex, sometimes cruel and a little too often abstruse experience. Managing the
                    strategies of two cars - and micromanaging each driver to boot - can prove to be a taxing task, and
                    while it's satisfying to execute the perfect strategy there aren't quite enough tools at your
                    disposal to balance out the frustration that often accompanies raceday. The feedback you're given by
                    drivers is a little too obscure, the ability to read lap times and deltas a little too sparse to
                    make chasing the perfect set-up anything other than a dark art. ... Motorsport Manager's a couple of
                    tweaks away from greatness, then, but it's far from a disappointment."[28]</p>

            <h4>Reviews</h4>
            <p class="col">On GameStar, Benjamin Danneberg says: "Motorsport Manager is not a hardcore management
                game, where I have to put every screw correctly. Instead, the game is a healthy way of strategy and
                fun."[17] Motorsport.com's Valentin Khorounzhiy writes: "Motorsport Manager is a great game on its
                own merit and a roaring success for a subgenre that seems to be waking up from a long hiatus. Its
                price tag may seem steep to some, but it's got enough content and variety to justify it. ... There's
                potential for improvement, yes, but Playsport has done an admirable job with the first installment –
                and it will hopefully move enough copies to justify many, many follow-ups."[29]</p>
            <p class="col">
                James Swinbanks of PC PowerPlay writes: "There is always something going on behind the scenes in
                Motorsport Manager, and it always adds to the experience. I never felt cheated, even when things
                didn’t go my way. ... It's not perfect; a few setup quirks, like increasing rear wing angle adding
                understeer, don’t make any sense and had me scratching my head trying to work out why they might
                design it that way. But in the grand scheme of things, Motorsport Manager does what I want it to do.
                It puts me on the pit wall, in the thick of it." The website gave a score of 8/10.[16] DSport
                Magazine gave the first PC version a positive response in its review, noting the level of
                micromanaging was scalable depending on how intensive the player wanted the strategizing to be.[30]
